  = Changed
    -Display of License information and added more to improve visibility

= [1.0] - 2017-01-12 (Initial)
  = Added
    - 'Dissension' theme

= Known issues:
  = Hyperlinks (except for links in chat and channel description), friend/foe name colours, name colours in 3DSoundWidget, position of user avatars and status icons, etc use default style
    = Those values are hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side. A style implementation by the TeamSpeak team is unprovided for in the foreseeable future (http://goo.gl/WTVSQA).
  = QTabBar::scroller overlaps tabs (see https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-50866)
  = QTabBar::tab doesn't work very well with transparency (see https://forum.qt.io/topic/42265/qtabwidget-stylesheet-white-top-border/6)
  = PreviewWidget has no style (style option needs to be implemented by the TeamSpeak team)
  = VADDisplay has very limited style-capabilities.
  = Private channels are using register.png instead of channel_private.png. Nothing I can do from my side.
  = "Customize Toolbar" separator icon seems to be hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side.
  = "Customize Toolbar" QToolBar icons seem to be hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side.
  = "Expand QMenuBar" and "Expand QToolBar" (if Main Window width is too small to display full Menu and Tool Bar) icons seem to be hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side.
  = Overwolf icon is hard-coded and cannot be changed from my side.
  = Drop zones of certain objects (ToolBar for example) seem to be hard-coded.
  = Add-ons that use QOpenGLWidget are not supported by this theme and may be limited in functionality.
  = Add-ons that print messages in chat may use hard-coded text colours.
  = QMessageBox in Sound3DWidget seems non-customisable. Too rare to pursue.
  = Addon "Browse Online" feature is pulling information straight from the web and cannot be styled
  = AreYouSureDialog seems to make use of a hardcoded icon
  = QListView::item:disabled:hover does not work ('Server Group Dialog')
  = QDial offers only very limited support for style sheets (only default border, default handle ("overlay" over background-color, may result in a handle appearing too dark/black with certain colours, doesn't accept all colours) - (https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-1160)
  = QLCDNumber offers limited support for style sheets (Raised style of LCD numbers, using white colour to achieve this effect, limits "styleability")
  = 'Tools -> Identities' and 'Tools -> Options -> Security -> Identity Manager' are literally the same, but somehow the latter needs extra styling (QListWidget)
  = QLineEdit that expect certain input use hard-coded error background-color when input failed (No input in forced password field, 'Permission -> List All Clients -> Search by: Fail three character min-requirement)
  = BadgeIconWidget#badgeX seems non-styleable
  = QComboBoxPrivateContainer (Client/Server Log -> Highlighting -> Foreground/Background color appears to be unstylable)
  = QTreeView::item:hover:disabled doesn't seem to work/exist (Addon Compatibility)

= Inspired by Discord menu interface and colour scheme
